# AISC_Mask_Violation_Python

Hello everyone my name is Arnav Suman. Iâ€™m a Student of class 11 and a member of AI Student Community. And I Am here to present my Solution to the Challenge of the Month of March. 

So, I have Developed an OpenCv model in Python to detect names of students who are not wearing their masks properly in their classrooms. I have developed a model with sample images of Bollywood heroes with nearly 600 images and with an accuracy of 76%.
Python Code is Provided in Python Folder.

Along with Developing the Python Program for identifying Students not wearing masks, I have also developed an android and ios app in Dart and Flutter so that Teachers have a Dashboard and can get an insight of who in their class are not wearing masks correctly and appropriate action could be taken.
Dart and Flutter Code is given in dart Folder.
